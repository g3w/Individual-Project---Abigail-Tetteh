# Individual-Project---Abigail-Tetteh
The assignment has five java files and one word document on the reflection report

The project focuses on determining the optimal route taht helps travellers move from one city to another using different flights.
The algorithm used is the uniform cost search algorithm which gives priority to the distance covered between two airports 
The projects has three classes for all the three csv files provided for the assignment and the main ain classes supporting the accurate implementation of the search 
algorithm are the Problem, Node and RouteFinder class which collectively computes the optimal route when an input file containing the traveller's journey details are provided
The computed route is then written to an ouput file. Thank you
